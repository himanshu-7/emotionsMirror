##emotionsMirror

This repository holds some stitched code from snippets around the internet, 
to make a photobooth app on Raspberry Pi3. The photobooth also shows your emotions determined by Google's Vision API.
Need a webcam, some free gpio and Google's Vision API to work. 

* `emotions23.py`: This commit fixes non functional snippets to working code
* `fetch_dependencies.sh`: This commit gives some idea about the dependencies on a fresh install of Raspbian Stretch on RPi3
